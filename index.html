                    Wangari Maathai was the founder of the Green Belt Movement and the 2004 Nobel Peace Prize Laureate.
                    She authored four books: The Green Belt Movement; Unbowed: A Memoir; The Challenge for Africa; and
                    Replenishing the Earth. As well as having been featured
                    in a number of books, she and the Green Belt Movement were the subject of a documentary film, Taking
                    Root: the Vision of Wangari Maathai (Marlboro Productions, 2008).

                    Wangari Muta Maathai was born in Nyeri, a rural area of Kenya (Africa), in 1940. She obtained a
                    degree in Biological Sciences from Mount St. Scholastica College in Atchison, Kansas (1964), a
                    Master of Science degree from the University of Pittsburgh (1966),
                    and pursued doctoral studies in Germany and the University of Nairobi, before obtaining a Ph.D.
                    (1971) from the University of Nairobi, where she also taught veterinary anatomy. The first woman in
                    East and Central Africa to earn a doctorate degree,
                    Professor Maathai became chair of the Department of Veterinary Anatomy and an associate professor in
                    1976 and 1977 respectively. In both cases, she was the first woman to attain those positions in the
                    region.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Professor Maathai was active in the National Council of Women of Kenya (1976–1987) and was its
                    chairman (1981–1987). In 1976, while she was serving in the National Council of Women, Professor
                    Maathai introduced the idea of community-based tree planting.
                    She continued to develop this idea into a broad-based grassroots organisation, the Green Belt
                    Movement (GBM), whose main focus is poverty reduction and environmental conservation through tree
                    planting.
